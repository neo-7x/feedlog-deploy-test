-- Data-only migration: seeds a sentinel user + 3 welcome items.
-- Each INSERT is gated on the target table being empty so upgrades on
-- existing installs are a no-op — the migration only populates a fresh DB.
--
-- The 'system' user has no account row, so it cannot log in; it only
-- satisfies the NOT NULL author_id text column on item.
